# Simon-says-game
Overview

This project is a simple game where players must remember and replicate a sequence of button flashes. The game progressively increases in difficulty as the sequence grows longer with each level. The player’s goal is to achieve the highest level possible.

How It Works

Starting the Game:

Press any key to start the game.

The game initializes at Level 1 and generates a random color sequence.

Gameplay:

The game flashes a button corresponding to a color in the sequence.

Players must click buttons in the same order as the flashed sequence.

User Actions:

Clicking a button adds that button’s color to the user sequence.

If the user sequence matches the game sequence, the next level begins with a longer sequence.

Game Over:

If the user sequence does not match the game sequence, the game ends.

The player’s score (highest level achieved) is displayed.

Restarting the Game:

Press any key to reset and start the game again.
